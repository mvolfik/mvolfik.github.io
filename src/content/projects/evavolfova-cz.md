  Since 2018, I've been maintaining this website and e-shop. The first version was a simple static website generated with Frozen-Flask. However, as my skills improved, I got to iterate many new technologies, landing on the current stack of SvelteKit, custom server for assets written in Rust, and NetlifyCMS.

  With this project, I also learned a lot about how to manage a full VPS – along with the server itself, I'm self-hosting Caddy, Plausible analytics and a Postgres database in a Docker-compose cluster. I've also setup Grafana with alerts to monitor server load etc.
