Hi, I'm Matěj!

Are you looking for <a id="cvclick" href="/s/CV-volf-matej.pdf" target="_blank">my CV</a>?

I do a lot of different things:

- I have just finished my Bc. degree in Computer Science at Charles University in Prague
- I worked part-time as a Node.js engineer at the Czech startup [Apify](https://apify.com)
- I'm volunteering as an organizer of [Protab](https://protab.cz), a camp for high-schoolers interested in computer science
- I'm a big fan of riding a bike as a means of transport. Fix your bike at [Bike Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/bikekitchenpraha), read news about urbanism at [Městem na kole](https://mestemnakole.cz/), or join us for a little bit of non-violent activism at [Critical Mass](https://www.facebook.com/prazska.cyklopoezie)

And I did even more stuff in the past. I was active in [European Youth Parliament](https://www.eyp.cz) and a few other student organizations. But most of my time was still spent coding, so here's a few of my projects that I'm proud of:
