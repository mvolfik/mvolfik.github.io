Hey, I'm Matěj! (Are you looking for <a id="cvclick" href="/CV-volf-matej.pdf" target="_blank">my CV</a>?) I do a lot of different things:

- I'm studying Computer Science (well, mainly just writing my thesis) Charles University, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics
- This academic year, I also took up a Bachelor's programme in Danish and Finnish philology at the Faculty of Arts
- I'm working part-time as a Node.js engineer at the Czech startup [Apify](https://apify.com)
- I'm volunteering as an organizer of [Protab](https://protab.cz), a camp for high-schoolers interested in computer science
- I'm a big fan of riding a bike as a means of transport. Fix your bike at [Bike Kitchen](https://www.facebook.com/bikekitchenpraha), read news about urbanism at [Městem na kole](https://mestemnakole.cz/), or join us for a little bit of non-violent activism at [Critical Mass](https://www.facebook.com/prazska.cyklopoezie)

And I did even more stuff in the past. I was active in [European Youth Parliament](https://www.eyp.cz) and a few other student organizations. But most of my time was still spent coding, so here's a few of my projects that I'm proud of:
