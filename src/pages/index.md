      My entry job into the world of real-world IT. It's not the time to fully reflect on this job yet,
      but so far I'm really enjoying the opportunity to learn from experienced engineers, from platform
      DevOps managers to front-end engineers to senior web automation devs. The open and free company
      culture allows me to get maximum insight and learning opportunities at this position.

Hello! My name is Matěj and I'm from Prague, Czech Republic. I'm currently in the second year
of Bc. in Computer Science at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles University.
I'm also part-time employed at the Czech startup [Apify](https://apify.com) in the role of a
_Node.js engineer / Web Automation developer_.

<p class="noprint">Here
you can find a showcase of my previous work and what technologies I enjoy working
with. Apart from my current job at Apify, where I'm enjoying the possibility to work
with and learn from experienced engineers with many different expertises, when I was
at high school I worked on several projects of my own and I also made a few minor
contributions to various open-source projects.</p>
