      My entry job into the world of real-world IT. It's not the time to fully reflect on this job yet,
      but so far I'm really enjoying the opportunity to learn from experienced engineers, from platform
      DevOps managers to front-end engineers to senior web automation devs. The open and free company
      culture allows me to get maximum insight and learning opportunities at this position.

Hello! My name is Matěj and I'm from Tábor, Czech Republic. This May I graduated from
high school and I'm continuing my studies of Computer Science at the Faculty of
Mathematics and Physics at Charles University in Prague. I'm currently employed at the
Czech startup [Apify](https://apify.com) in the role of a _Node.js engineer / Web
Automation developer_.

Here you can find a showcase of my previous work and what technologies I enjoy working
with. Apart from my current job at Apify, where I'm enjoying the possibility to work
with and learn from experienced engineers with many different expertises, when I was
at high school I worked on several projects of my own and I also made a few minor
contributions to various open-source projects.
