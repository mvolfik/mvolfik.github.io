Hello! My name is Matěj and I'm from Tábor, Czech Republic. This May, I'm graduating
from high school. After that, I'm going to continue my studies of Computer Science at
the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at Charles' University in Prague. **I'll be happy
to hear about job opportunities suitable for my skills and time availability** (I'll be a
college student starting in October).

In this single-page portfolio you can find a showcase of what I can do and what I've done.
I don't have any _"real"_ software engineering work experience, so it's hard for me to
estimate how my coding skills stand in comparison with the outside world. But I'm able to
participate in technical disussions, and made a few minor contributions to various
open-source projects. You can see a breakdown of my preferred technologies and how
confident I am in working with them in the column on the left.

### My story & history of used tech

My first bigger projects used Python + Flask, with small sprinkles of disorganized
JavaScript. About a year and a half ago I got more into the JS world and worked a lot
especially with Svelte(Kit). With Svelte, I enjoyed working on the _interactivity_ part
of frontend, but the design side was never my strong point. During Advent of Code 2021,
I learned Rust, which I really enjoyed later using for my high-school graduation project.
