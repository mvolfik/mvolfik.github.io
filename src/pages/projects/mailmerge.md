  One of the smaller projects of mine. When Google introduced security changes that prevented my favourite mailmerge add-on from working, I decided to write my own batch mailing solution in Python. The script uses front-matter for metadata, and Markdown + Jinja for email body.

  My favourite feature is the possibility to triple-check everything – unless you opt out, you get a preview of each email (both plaintext and HTML), and you can even fake-send all emails to your own address to check attachments etc.
