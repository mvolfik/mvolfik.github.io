  As my Individual Software project at Matfyz (and potentially my Bachelor's thesis), I am working on providing support for the HelenOS operating system to the Rust compiler, i.e. allow compiling Rust programs for HelenOS. I am very much in the beginning of this project and there isn't anything that I have to show yet.
