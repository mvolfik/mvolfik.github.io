  As my Bachelor Thesis, I am working on providing support for the <a href="https://www.helenos.org">HelenOS operating system</a> to the Rust compiler, i.e. allow compiling Rust programs for HelenOS. This had me digging in the internals of Rust standard library, LLVM configuration, and requires a deep understanding of the ELF binary format, the linking procedure and generally a very good understanding of concepts used in modern operating systems.
