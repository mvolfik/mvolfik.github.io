    <meta name="description" content="A web app for better management of homework.

During the first wave of COVID-19 lockdowns in March 2020, homeschooling for many students at my school became a mess. Teachers were assigning us homework using Bakaláři (system commonly used by Czech schools), but the program worked with completely different assumptions and absolutely wasn't prepared for homeschooling. Therefore I created Bakatasklist to allow importing assignments, viewing them in a sortable table and manually marking finished/unfinished assignments.

Unfortunately, the API I used for importing homework was replaced a few months later. I planned to create a second version which would use the new API and also allow importing from other systems including Google Classroom, but all the schools systems rapidly improved, and we went back to schools before I was done, so it was never completed. Stub of this project is, however, available to see.
